## Description 
  This generator was created as part of my homework but also as a way for me to create a readme for any project in simple easy steps. It allows me to not have to go through the trouble of writing markdown but answering simple questions that will generate me a functional readme.
## Table of Contents
  - [Installation](#installation)
 - [Usage](#usage) 
 - [Contributing Guidlines](#contributing) 
 - [Tests](#tests) 
 - [Questions](#questions) 
 - [License](#license)
## Installation 
  Clone the repository to your local machine. In the directory run (npm i -y) then node (index.js) to run the program
## Usage 
  Answer the prompts about each section of the readme. This program also includes some discriptions of what to add in each section as a helping guide. Then give the readme a name and you're all set.
## Contributing 
  Right now no contribution is necessary.
## Tests 
  Check out the code and change what you dont like. I would like to add more options with the table of contents possibly you can do that on your own.
